# Array Operations
Array data structure supports following basic operations - 
1. Traverse
2. Insertion
3. Deletion
4. Search
5. Update


## 1. Traverse 
   In Traversing operation every element of an array will be visited for processing for only once.  
   
``` 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int arr_A[]={10,80,40,70,60};
    int i;
    cout<<"Elements of Array A are:"
    for(i=0;i<5;i++)
    {
    cout<<"arr_A["<<"]="<<arr_A[i]<<"\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```   
## 2. Insertion 
   Intsertion operation is to insert one or more elements into an array. The element can be inserted at the begining, end or at any given position.
   

## 3. Deletion 
   Deletion operation refers to removing an element from an array. In order to remove the element from an array you have to reorganize the elements of an array. 

## 4. Search
   Searching operation helps to check the existance of a particular element into the array.

## 5. Update âˆ’ Updates an element at the given index.
   The Updating operation refers to updating the existing element value from an array at a given index.
