# Data Structure

Data structure is a way of collecting and organizing data in computer’s memory so that it can be used to perform operations efficiently. Here the term data refers to any tangible raw values like numbers, words, alphabets, strings etc. For example, Let us consider the statement like ‘A student named **‘Amit’** has scored **‘95’** marks in the subject of Mathematics’. Here the student’s name **‘Amit’** and his marks **‘95’**are the raw values. 

When the data is organized in a structured format, it becomes easy to apply functions or operations to the data. We can group the data values to form a data structure. For example, we can store marks of one subject of all students into single variable name like ‘Sub1Math’ and then refer the individual values by specifying its index value. A well-designed data structure takes less space for storing data, less time to execute operations on data and optimum resources to execute the data.

A data structures is also known as Abstract Data Type (ADT) since the behavior of data structure is defined by a set of values and its operations. The keyword abstract (i.e.name of data structure) itself specifies the type of operations to be performed. The implementation of these operations is hidden from the users.  For example, The Push and Pop operations can be performed on Stack data structure. Here the user need not to know about the function definition of Push and Pop operations.

## Classification of Data Structures

1.  **Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous Data Structures**

    In Homogeneous data structure all data elements are of same data type viz. Array whereas in Non-Homogeneous data structure contains the elements of different data types viz. Linked List.

2.  **Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures**

    In Linear data structure the elements are arranged in a linear sequence viz. Array, Linked List, Queue, Stack etc. whereas in Non-Linear data structure elements do not follow a specific sequence like Tree and Graph data structure.

3.  **Static and Dynamic Data Structures**

    Static data structure has fixed memory occupation viz. Array whereas Dynamic data structures has varying memory occupation.
